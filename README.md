# multiuser
Everything that I find useful for monitoring my multi-user
server, even if they are just my friends.

I wrote everything, so that means that there are probably
numerous ways to do something better.

Anyways, on to the contents!

## `push`
`push` simply pushes files from the directory you are in
to a certain target directory.

I made this because my friend is learning web development,
and I gave him an account on my server so he could actually
make some websites. This just makes things easier for everyone.


## `pushpush`, soon to be `multiupdate`
`pushpush`, right now, just goes out to `/usr/bin`, where this
stuff will be kept so others can use it, and it deletes all the files.
Then, it copies everything from this repo back up there.

Why? Because this allows me to do every bit of development from here,
then send it back so everyone can use it.


## `colors.py`
This is just a python library of colors, to be used for solarized
terminals. It just makes things look fancy.

## `announce`
This magical thing is a program... THAT WRITES A PROGRAM.

It writes an `announcement` program, and all it does right now is make
a file that prints the message, then asks if you want it deleted. It
only works for the person that runs it as of now.

## `qannouncement`
An example of the `announcement` file that would be created with
`announce`.

## `del`
A very short program to easily delete the `qannouncement` file from
testing.

## There will definitely be more, it's just in the works.
